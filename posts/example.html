            This week, I'm going to write about why defining requirements is important.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The argument is actually really simple. Defining requirements is how you do 
            anything well because these requirements, i.e. your expectations, define 
            what "well" is.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            "But just because <em>I</em> think I'm a good engineer, product manager, 
            tennis player etc., that doesn't mean everyone else will think that too!"
          </p>
          
          <p>
            True. There is a big difference between your own requirements, other people's 
            requirements, and the world's expectations. These things will inevitably 
            influence and inform each other, but it is really important to not mix 
            those things up. The earlier people realize this, the bigger of a head start 
            they have on all the people who go through high school, college, and life 
            thereafter unquestioningly allowing themselves to be pushed into canonically 
            successful career paths.
          </p>
          
          <p>From Patrick Collison's advice for people 10-20:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              If you're in the US and go to a good school, there are a lot of forces 
              that will push you towards following train tracks laid by others rather 
              than charting a course yourself. Make sure that the things you're pursuing 
              are weird things that <em>you</em> want to pursue, not whatever the 
              standard path is. Heuristic: do your friends at school think your path 
              is a bit strange? If not, maybe it's too normal.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

            I haven't updated my mental model here in a while apparently. I previously 
            thought that thinking deeply about this was only something that people who 
            were <em>perfectionists</em> had to worry about. Since I have always identified 
            as a very practical person, I amazingly didn't realize this was something 
            I needed to work on a lot.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm gonna talk about a few examples of things that made me realize that this 
            is actually a super important skill that everyone should develop.
